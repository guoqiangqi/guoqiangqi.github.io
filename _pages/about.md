### I'm [QI](https://github.com/guoqiangqi)(he/his) ðŸ‘‹
  
An open source enthusiast, hardware-minded software engineer, and a "slides engineer" at Huawei. In the early years, I focused on object detection and recognition in the field of deep learning. I came into contact with the community when I reproduced the PFLD network and released it as open source. After joining the Huawei 2012 Laboratory, I was responsible for optimizing industry and self-developed math libraries such as Eigenï¼ŒNubma and KML, which were also contributed to the open source community. Currently, my role involves managing developer relations and experience (DevRel & DX) in the open source community and taking care of five kittens.
  
### Skills

- ðŸŒ± Familiar with Deep Learning(Object Detection) / AutoML(NAS) and Numerical Optimization.  

- ðŸ”­ Used to be a core contributor to Eigen(as a member), which is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms. Eigen is also used in Tensorflow.  

- âœ¨ Also, i made contributions to Numba, which is a JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code for scientific computing.

- âš¡ I own the [PFLD](https://github.com/guoqiangqi/PFLD) Github Project, that is an open-source implementation based on Tensorflow for Face Landmark Detection.
