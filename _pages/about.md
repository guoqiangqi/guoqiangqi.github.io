### Hi there, i'm [QI](https://github.com/guoqiangqi)(he/his) 👋

- 🌱 An open-source enthusiast and familiar with [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)(Object Detection) / [AutoML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning)(NAS) and [Numerical Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization).  

- 🔭 I used to be a core contributor to [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen)(as a member), which is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms. Eigen is also used in [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).  

- ✨ Also, i made contributions to [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba), which is a JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code for scientific computing.

- ⚡ I own the [PFLD](https://github.com/guoqiangqi/PFLD) Github Project, that is an open-source implementation based on Tensorflow for [Face Landmark Detection](https://github.com/guoqiangqi/PFLD).

### More
A software engineer with a hardware background, and a JiaoPian engineer at Huawei. In the early years, I focused on target detection and recognition in the field of deep learning. I came into contact with the community when I reproduced the PFLD network and released it as open source. After joining the Huawei 2012 Laboratory, I was responsible for optimizing industry and self-developed math libraries such as Eigen and Nubma, which were also contributed to the open source community. Currently, my role involves managing developer relations and experience (DevRel & DX) in the open source community and taking care of five kittens.
